# TechDegree-Unit5
This whole project involves importing some data and answering some questions about it - with the ethos of "explain your reasoning".  In general, to emphasize what we've learned, we will attempt the vectorized approach to answering all questions.

The questions are:
 1. Is there an area where more pets are found?
    * Find the top 5 places where animals are found so the shelter can coordinate with local volunteers and animal control to monitor these areas. 
 1. What is the average number of pets found in a month in the year 2015? Are there months where there is a higher number of animals found?
    * Knowing the number of pets the shelter might see in a month can help them gather enough resources and donations to care for the animals they receive. 
 1. What is the ratio of incoming pets vs. adopted pets?
    * This key metric helps the shelter know how they are doing.
 1. What is the distribution of the types of animals in the shelter?
    * Find the count of each type of animal in the shelter.
 1. What are the adoption rates for specific breeds?
    * Find the top 5 dog breeds in the shelter (based on count) and then find the adoption percentage of each breed.
 1. What are the adoption rates for different colorings?
    * Find the top 5 colorings in the shelter (based on count) and then find the adoption percentage of each color.
 1. About how many animals are spayed/neutered each month?
    * This will help the shelter allocate resources and staff. Assume that all intact males and females will be spayed/neutered.    
 ### Extra Credit Questions
 
 1. How many animals in the shelter are repeats? Which animal was returned to the shelter the most?
    * This means the animal has been brought in more than once.
 1. What are the adoption rates for the following age groups?

    baby: 4 months and less
    young: 5 months - 2 years
    adult: 3 years - 10 years
    senior: 11+

 1. If spay/neuter for a dog costs $100 and a spay/neuter for a cat costs $50, how much did the shelter spend in 2015 on these procedures?

## For All Questions
 - Describe your findings and methods. Use markdown cells in JupyterLab to detail.

    * How did you get your answer?
    * What was your final answer?
